          Context:
          - Repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}

          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
          2) Review the current PR diff focusing on issues in priority order: bugs, security, performance, style
          3) Flag only clear, high-severity issues with emphasis on the priority areas
          4) Leave very short inline comments on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end, mention file path and line number

          Review Focus (in priority order):
          1) BUGS: Logic errors, missing error handling, incorrect assumptions, race conditions, null pointer exceptions
          2) SECURITY: Input validation, authentication/authorization, data exposure, injection vulnerabilities, unsafe operations
          3) PERFORMANCE: Inefficient algorithms, unnecessary loops, memory leaks, blocking operations, resource usage
          4) STYLE: Code formatting, naming conventions, documentation, code organization (only flag if significantly impacts readability)

          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - Identify the exact file path and line number for each issue
          - Prioritize issues according to the focus order above
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ‚úÖ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize bugs > security > performance > maintainability
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line with file path
          - Professional tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Be constructive but concise; avoid excessive praise or compliments
          - Focus on technical issues and improvements, not general appreciation
          - Use emojis: üö® Critical üîí Security ‚ö° Performance ‚ö†Ô∏è Logic ‚úÖ Resolved ‚ú® Improvement
          - For style issues, only comment if they significantly impact code readability or maintainability

          Inline Comment Format:
          - Use: gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body '<comment>' --path '<file-path>' --line <line-number>
          - Example: gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body 'üö® Critical: Missing import will cause NameError' --path 'stoobly_agent/cli.py' --line 128
          - For multi-line issues, use --start-line and --line
          - Always include the full relative file path from repository root

          Summary Comment:
          - After inline comments, post a summary: gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body '<summary>'
          - Include: number of critical issues, positive changes, and overall recommendation
          - Keep summary factual and concise; avoid excessive praise or compliments

          Important:
          - Use gh pr review for inline comments (with --path and --line)
          - Use gh pr comment for summary (no --path or --line)
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes"
