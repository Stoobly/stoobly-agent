# Define services here
#
# If a container service needs access to a Stoobly defined service, 
# then the container service needs to add one of the scaffolded networks to the 'networks' property
# See https://docs.stoobly.com/core-concepts/scaffold
# 
# Container services that are intended to be run as part of a workflow need to have the workflow name added to the 'profiles' property
# e.g. If we want to run a service as part of the 'record' workflow, then the following should be added
# profiles:
#   - record
services: {}
